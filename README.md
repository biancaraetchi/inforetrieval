## Report

When analyzing the effect of the variables `number_of_known_people` and `number_of_training_images_per_person`, the rejection threshold is incredibly important, since it affects both the accuracy scores and the confusion matrices. This is why we decided to first analyze the `rejection_threshold` and then pick the result with the highest accuracy score. This way, we have a baseline idea of what potential the proper selection of variables can reach.

As we can see above, the data seems to be distributed in a right-skewed bell curve: the numbers start off relatively low, with a 0.520 accuracy score for 0.1 `rejection_threshold`, reaching its peak at 0.45, with a 1 accuracy score, and then coming back down after around 0.75 `rejection_threshold`, with a 0.500 accuracy score. This suggests that the distance between the feature vectors of the known peoples' images from the respective `test` and `training` folders have no more than 0.45 cosine distance between them, while all of the ones from the `10` folder in `test` have a bigger distance than 0.45 compared to any of the known peoples' vectors. is also reflected in the confusion matrices, where the 0.5

For the next experiments, we will pick `rejection_threshold`=0.45 since it results in a perfect accuracy score.
