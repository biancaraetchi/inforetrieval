## Report

When analyzing the effect of the variables `number_of_known_people` and `number_of_training_images_per_person`, the rejection threshold is incredibly important, since it affects both the accuracy scores and the confusion matrices. This is why we decided to first analyze the `rejection_threshold` (with `number_of_known_people`=10 and `number_of_training_images_per_person`=10) and then pick the result with the highest accuracy score. This way, we have a baseline of what potential the proper selection of variables can reach.

For the next experiments, we will pick `rejection_threshold`=0.45 since it results in a perfect accuracy score.
